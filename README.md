# A Small, Doable RxJS Weekend Project

You're going to see a small RxJS app that warps you to a new solar system after a user presses a button.

- Part 1 is a fully working app you'll just read through.
- Part 2 is where you break that apart to make it more manageable.
- Part 3 adds some graphics to the interactivity. You'll still be relying heavily on pre-built code, and not doing too much more with RxJS, but I wanted to show you how easy it is to get started, switch to using RxJS by default when you do have "eventing" or reactive needs, then be setup for instant success when your needs get more complex.

I'm warping you once more [to the GH Pages doc]() for this to explain more, since there are too many limits to the GH READMEs.
